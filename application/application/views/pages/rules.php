<div id="left-body"><h2>Server Rules</h2>

<h3>Simple Server Rules</h3>
<ul>
	<li>ABSOLUTELY NO GRIEFING! (Vandalism of others work).</li>
	<li>Listen to Administrators and Moderators.</li>
	<li>This is a mostly free build server.</li>
	<li>Be a good person, trolls and troublemakers are not allowed.</li>
	<li>This is a private server, all new players must be added by the Administrator.  New players are strongly encouraged, refer your friends, the more the merrier!</li>
	<li>Client side modding (including but not limited to: flying, no-clip, Xray) is strictly prohibited for all players. Do not abuse commands.</li>
</ul>
<p>These rules should be sufficient for most people.  If you have further questions consult the expanded rules below BEFORE consulting moderators or admins.</p>
<p>You REALLY shouldn't need to read the expanded server rules, they simply attempt to clarify what the simple rules mean (because some people thought they weren't specific enough)</p>
