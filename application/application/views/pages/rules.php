<div id="left-body"><h2>Server Rules</h2>

<h3>Simple Server Rules</h3>
<ul>
	<li>ABSOLUTELY NO GRIEFING! (Vandalism of others work).</li>
	<li>Listen to Administrators and Moderators.</li>
	<li>This is a mostly free build server.</li>
	<li>Be a good person, trolls and troublemakers are not allowed.</li>
	<li>This is a private server, all new players must be added by the Administrator.  New players are strongly encouraged, refer your friends, the more the merrier!</li>
	<li>Client side modding (including but not limited to: flying, no-clip, Xray) is strictly prohibited for all players. Do not abuse commands.</li>
</ul>
<p>These rules should be sufficient for most people.  If you have further questions consult the expanded rules below BEFORE consulting moderators or admins.</p>
<p>You REALLY shouldn't need to read the expanded server rules, they simply attempt to clarify what the simple rules mean (because some people thought they weren't specific enough)</p>

	<h3>Expanded Server Rules and Terms of Service</h3>
	<div id="Section1">
		<h4><img onclick="show(1)" src="Assets/Images/Expand.png" alt="expand/collapse"> Section I - Griefing, Stealing, Etc.</h4>
		<ol id="sectionol1">
			<li>Griefing is generally defined on the Minecraft Wiki, this server uses the following definition as griefing:<?php echo br(2); ?>
				Griefing is the act of ruining large or very noticeable portions of other people's creations on the server, 
				breaking any portion of a players creation without repairing it, or putting up structures with the intent to 
				offend or make a statement to a person that violates section III.  Accidental creeper damage should be reported 
				but is not considered griefing.  Making improvements to a structure is not griefing, but must be removed if the 
				original owner objects.<?php echo br(2); ?>
				While not necessarily griefing, building large structures in the airspace over someone else's structure will 
				likely result in your structure getting removed.  Players are encouraged to ask for permission when unsure to be safe,  
				Moderators are instructed to store all materials from removed structures to later be claimed by the structure's builder.</li>
			<li>Stealing is prohibited.  If you didn't place the chest and you remove anything from it, you are stealing.  
				The only exception to this rule is with chests that are clearly and purposefully marked as public.  If you have ANY 
				doubt that the chest is public DO NOT touch it.</li>
			<li>Be aware <span class="underline">all</span> player actions, including but not limited to block breaking, door interaction, 
				chest interaction, chat, and block placing are logged.</li>
			<li>I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. What I do have are a very particular set of tools. Tools that make 
				me a nightmare for people like you. If you don't grief the server, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, 
				I will not pursue you. But if you do, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will ban you.</li>

	<div id="Section2">
		<h4><img onclick="show(2)" src="Assets/Images/Expand.png" alt="expand/collapse"> Section II - Authority</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Final and complete Administrative, Judicial, and Legislative authority lies in the possession of the server administrator.</li>
			<li>Moderators are given the authority to mute in chat and temporarily and/or permanently ban any user that blatantly ignores server rules.</li>
			<li>Moderators can give a warning before banning a player at their own discretion, but are not required to.</li>
			<li>Bans can only be overturned by the server Administrator.  Moderators do not have the power to unban players.</li>
