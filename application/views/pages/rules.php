<div id="left-body"><h2>Server Rules</h2>

<h3>Simple Server Rules</h3>
<ul>
	<li>ABSOLUTELY NO GRIEFING! (Vandalism of others work).</li>
	<li>Listen to Administrators and Moderators.</li>
	<li>This is a mostly free build server.</li>
	<li>Be a good person, trolls and troublemakers are not allowed.</li>
	<li>This is a private server, all new players must be added by the Administrator.  New players are strongly encouraged, refer your friends, the more the merrier!</li>
	<li>Client side modding (including but not limited to: flying, no-clip, Xray) is strictly prohibited for all players. Do not abuse commands.</li>
</ul>
<p>These rules should be sufficient for most people.  If you have further questions consult the expanded rules below BEFORE consulting moderators or admins.</p>
<p>You REALLY shouldn't need to read the expanded server rules, they simply attempt to clarify what the simple rules mean (because some people thought they weren't specific enough)</p>

	<h3>Expanded Server Rules and Terms of Service</h3>
	<div id="Section1">
		<h4><img onclick="show(1)" src="Assets/Images/Expand.png" alt="expand/collapse"> Section I - Griefing, Stealing, Etc.</h4>
		<ol id="sectionol1">
			<li>Griefing is generally defined on the Minecraft Wiki, this server uses the following definition as griefing:<?php echo br(2); ?>
				Griefing is the act of ruining large or very noticeable portions of other people's creations on the server, 
				breaking any portion of a players creation without repairing it, or putting up structures with the intent to 
				offend or make a statement to a person that violates section III.  Accidental creeper damage should be reported 
				but is not considered griefing.  Making improvements to a structure is not griefing, but must be removed if the 
				original owner objects.<?php echo br(2); ?>
				While not necessarily griefing, building large structures in the airspace over someone else's structure will 
				likely result in your structure getting removed.  Players are encouraged to ask for permission when unsure to be safe,  
				Moderators are instructed to store all materials from removed structures to later be claimed by the structure's builder.</li>
			<li>Stealing is prohibited.  If you didn't place the chest and you remove anything from it, you are stealing.  
				The only exception to this rule is with chests that are clearly and purposefully marked as public.  If you have ANY 
				doubt that the chest is public DO NOT touch it.</li>
			<li>Be aware <span class="underline">all</span> player actions, including but not limited to block breaking, door interaction, 
				chest interaction, chat, and block placing are logged.</li>
			<li>I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. What I do have are a very particular set of tools. Tools that make 
				me a nightmare for people like you. If you don't grief the server, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, 
				I will not pursue you. But if you do, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will ban you.</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	
	<div id="Section2">
		<h4><img onclick="show(2)" src="Assets/Images/Expand.png" alt="expand/collapse"> Section II - Authority</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Final and complete Administrative, Judicial, and Legislative authority lies in the possession of the server administrator.</li>
			<li>Moderators are given the authority to mute in chat and temporarily and/or permanently ban any user that blatantly ignores server rules.</li>
			<li>Moderators can give a warning before banning a player at their own discretion, but are not required to.</li>
			<li>Bans can only be overturned by the server Administrator.  Moderators do not have the power to unban players.</li>
			<li>All and any decisions by moderators can be appealed to an administrator via the Facebook group, Facebook Chat, or Skype.</li>
			<li>Moderators are given full spawning abilities, these abilities should be used to maintain and build server infrastructure (or 
				build cool things).  They are <span class="underline">strictly prohibited</span> from using these abilities to spawn items for players, build structures for 
				individual players, or using the abilities in any way that diminishes the survival feel of the server.  Moderators are to 
				destroy any and all spawned materials that they do not use, or place the materials in chests that they must monitor to make 
				sure items are not stolen.  Failure to reasonably prevent the theft of spawned items through close monitoring or destruction will be punished.</li>
			<li>The decisions of the server administrator are final and can be appealed to nobody.</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	
	<div id="Section3">
		<h4><img onclick="show(3)" src="Assets/Images/Expand.png" alt="expand/collapse"> Section III - Structures and Free Build</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>This is a free build server except as stated otherwise in this section.</li>
			<li>The erecting of offensive structures and signs is prohibited (with certain exceptions)<?php echo br(2); ?>
				In order to be considered offensive a structure or sign must threaten a specific reasonable person or 
				offend and/or threaten a group of reasonable persons.<?php echo br(2); ?>
				<ul>
					<li>For purposes of this section, a "reasonable person" is a reasonable person who is a member of or 
						distinguished by one of the following: race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, gender, 
						or sexual orientation, or who has a mental, physical, or sensory handicap.</li>
					<li>For purposes of this section, "Offensive"is defined as being remarks which are generally 
						considered by society as a whole to be offensive to the specific groups listed in the "reasonable person" 
						explanation.</li>
					<li>For purposes of this section, "Threaten" is defined as communicating, directly or indirectly, the intent to:
						<ul>
							<li>Cause bodily injury immediately or in the future to the person threatened or to any other person.</li>
							<li>Cause physical damage immediately or in the future to the property of a person threatened or that of any other person.</li>
						</ul></li>
				</ul>
				<?php echo br(1); ?>
				Nothing in this sub-section confers or expands any rights or protections to any group or class identified under this sub-section, beyond those rights or 
				protections that exist under the other sections of server law.  Nothing in this sub-section exempts said groups from escaping Section I (or any other section) of server law.</li>
			<li>Sexually explicit material and giant swear words are generally prohibited.  Exception if they are totally and completely hidden from view from a player walking around and COMPLETELY 
				INVISIBLE to the DynMap (EG: in a house).</li>
			<li>Anything that violates the rules laid out in Section I is in violation.</li>
			<li>Interpretation of these rules is at the Administrator's discretion, the administrator can decide any building is in some violation of the principles of the server and have it removed 
				regardless of what it is, or decide to keep a structure which may be in violation.</li>
			<li>Structures or signs that indicate a clear and present danger to a person on the server or the general public will be reported to the police pursuant to Section VII Subsection A.</li>
			<li>General Note: This section is not enforced very often, and generally you don't need to worry about it.</li>

	<div id="Section4">
		<h4><img onclick="show(4)" src="Assets/Images/Expand.png" alt="expand/collapse"> Section IV - General Definition of Trolling and Server Conduct Rules</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>No Trolling or deliberate disruption of discussion. Inflammatory chat is generally unacceptable and may be moderated. Inflammatory, or unnecessarily argumentative messages, or signs will be considered trolling. Extended debate with moderators or admins over their decisions with regard to moderation of the server is considered trolling. Do not subvert conversation. It is acceptable to state concern for how a particular server policy, performance, or procedure does or does not meet the expectation of a particular member, but it is not acceptable to use this server or its services in an attempt to broadly organize or incite members en masse, to leave the server, undertake legal (or illegal) action or otherwise disrupt the normal operation of the server.<?php echo br(2); ?>
				It is fair to state disagreement with facts or conclusions that another member has stated or a moderator has ruled, but dissent must be expressed in an objective, and reasoned manner. Treat others with the respect you wish to receive.</li>
			<li>Command spamming or abuse that causes the server to become slow or unresponsive, or that negatively affects the enjoyment of players on the server is prohibited.</li>
			<li>Chat messages which present a clear and present danger to a person on the server or the general public will be reported to police pursuant to Section VII Subsection A.</li>
			<li>If you engage a moderator in battle and somehow kill them, their inventory is yours BUT you must return any and all spawned items that are normally impossible for a regular player to obtain.</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	
	<div id="Section5">
		<h4><img onclick="show(5)" src="Assets/Images/Expand.png" alt="expand/collapse"> Section V - Regarding this Server Being Private</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>This is a controlled private server, all new players must agree to abide by these rules and be whitelisted by the server admin.</li>
			<li>In order to identify members your first and last name will be made available to members of the server.  In no situation should this data, or will this data be shared with those outside of the Minecraft server for any reason except as stated in Section VII.</li>
		</ol>

	<div id="Section6">
		<h4><img onclick="show(6)" src="Assets/Images/Expand.png" alt="expand/collapse"> Section IV - Client Side Mods</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>A client side mod is any modification you have made to Minecraft on your own computer.</li>
			<li>Client side mods with unfair effects on yours and others play are prohibited. Such mods include but are not limited to mods that allow you to do things such as:
				<ul>
					<li>X-Ray</li>
					<li>No Clipping (Flying)</li>
					<li>Speed modification</li>
					<li>Automation of your player (macros, automatic or semi automatic robots)</li>
					<li>Smart moving (climbing)</li>
				</ul>
				You may have these mods installed (I have no way to tell), but their use on the server is prohibited.  There are anti-cheating systems running on the server that can detect their use.</li>
			<li>Certain client side mods that do not effect play on the server are allowed to be used. Examples of these kind of mods include (but are not limited to):
				<ul>
					<li>Texture packs! (Just keep in mind that other people are likely using the default pack)</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/123409-123-wdmods-creepers-sneak-and-chat/">Improved Chat</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/52079-mrmmods-betterlightgrass-simplemap-181/">Better light</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/482147-125-apr08-reis-minimap-v30-04/">Minimap</a> (unless the mini map reveals ores, dungeons, or other normally hidden features)</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/120261-125-glsl-shaders-dof-bump-mapping-waving-wheat-dynamic-shadows-and-more/">HLSL Shaders</a></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>The server will not put in place any system that requires the user to download a client-side mod to enjoy until <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/s0pqt/i_am_nathan_adams_aka_dinnerbone_developer_of/c4a5w71?context=1">such a time that the Minecraft Modding API allows us to do this seamlessly</a>.</li>

	<div id="Section7">
		<h4><img onclick="show(7)" src="Assets/Images/Expand.png" alt="expand/collapse"> Section VII - General Disclaimers and Notices, Privacy Policy</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>This server is hosted in the State of Washington of the United States of America and as such must comply with any state and federal law as defined in the US Code and the Revised Code of Washington.  The server administrator may access or disclose information about you, including the content of your communications, IP Addresses, and other personally identifiable information, in order to: (a) comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of NCLF and our associates, including the enforcement of any agreements or policies governing your use of the services; or (c) act on a good faith belief that such access or disclosure is necessary to protect the personal safety of server users, the server itself, or the public.  These are the only times your information may be disclosed intentionally.</li>
			<li>Be aware that all chat, public and private, is logged.  However this chat will not be specifically monitored, inspected, or released intentionally except in the cases stated above.  While this chat is not actively monitored, it is possible (however not particularly likely) that chat could be intercepted while the administration is carrying out server maintenance and debugging, as the chat is visible in plain text on the console and in the debug logs.</li>
			<li>The server administrator reserves the right to bend, break, or ignore server rules at his own discretion until such a time that the universe collapses upon itself and Minecraft ceases to exist.</li>
			<li>Typos, grammar, and general errors in this document mean nothing as the Administrator has the right to do whatever he damn well pleases to you.</li>
